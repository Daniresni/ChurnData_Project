# Customer Churn Prediction

# Overview

This project aims to predict customer churn for a telecommunications company within a 5-year period. Using data visualization, Python, and machine learning, the analysis identifies key factors influencing churn and builds predictive models to enhance customer retention strategies.

## Features

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding data distributions and identifying key patterns.

- Data Preprocessing (PREP): Handling missing values, feature engineering, and data scaling.

- Machine Learning Models: Implementing and evaluating classification algorithms to predict churn.

- Tableau Visualization: Analyzing the results of the machine learning model through interactive dashboards.


## Technologies Used

- Python

- Pandas, NumPy

- Matplotlib, Seaborn

- Scikit-learn

- Jupyter Notebook

- Tableau


## Installation

Clone the repository:

[git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
](https://github.com/Daniresni/ChurnData_Project)

Navigate to the project directory:

cd your-repo

Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the Jupyter Notebook to explore the analysis and models.

Use Tableau to visualize the processed dataset and model results.


## Usage

Open the notebook and run the cells sequentially.

Modify parameters and explore different machine learning models.

Analyze the visualizations to gain insights into customer churn behavior.

Use the Tableau dashboard to explore the final dataset and predictions interactively.
